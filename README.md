# Microchip AVR-IoT WHA (Wireless for Home Assistant) Application

The aim here is to set up the AVR-IoT with an [MQTT Light](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/light.mqtt/) using [MQTT Discovery](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/)

The data pin for the NeoPixels must be connected to PC0 on the AVR-IoT board.
As of now I have not figured out how to set number of NeoPixels from HA, so one must do that from the CLI.

Connect to the COM port of the AVR IoT and use the CLI to configure wifi, mqtt connection and credentials (9600 BAUD).
Any terminal with serial support can be used, I like the [MPLAB Data Visualizer](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/debug/mplab-data-visualizer) a lot, at least if you want to output a lot of raw data from the MCU

## The debug info looks like this

FYI, this repo is a fork of [avr-iot-mqtt-ha-sensor-node](https://github.com/echoromeo/avr-iot-mqtt-ha-sensor-node) but since that repo is a fork of [avr-iot-aws-sensor-node-mplab](https://github.com/microchip-pic-avr-solutions/avr-iot-aws-sensor-node-mplab) github did not allow me to fork it.
